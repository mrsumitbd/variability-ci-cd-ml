# We don't want to trigger travis builds for auto PR because there are
# too many of them and they are updated very frequently. travis can
# barely catchup and so causing the build status of these PRs always
# being shown as pending.

# For each PR, travis triggers two builds, one is "branch updates"
# which uses the commit in the PR branch, another one is "pull request
# updates" which uses the merge commit that merges the PR branch into
# master branch. The following branches filter will only be able to
# disable builds of "branch updates", but not the "pull request
# updates", because the latter has branch name "master". To achieve
# that, we have turned off "Build pull request updates" option in the
# travis website.
